Use the vericonnex branding:
- primary: '#173115'

- favicon: https://github.com/Gridwise-Energy/assessment-engine/blob/main/public/favicon.ico

Other images should be grabbed from [https://gridwiseenergy.com.au/](https://gridwiseenergy.com.au/)

In terms of Jekyll templates lest start with [jekyll-agency](https://github.com/raviriley/agency-jekyll-theme).  To modify this the content shown look at this repo and figure out which files to create locally and modify them.
